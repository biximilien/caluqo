# CALUQO

This is a calendar web application I made during my time at Université du Québec
en Outaouais (UQO) to group all events happening on campus in a single calendar.

It works by keeping track of the University's, local businesses, unions',
committees', or groups' Facebook Pages and parse their upcoming events via the
Facebook Graph API. All events were aggregated into a customizable calendar the
user can choose which events he wants to see.
